## Task Description
This project is part of the CodTech Python Internship. The objective of Task 2 is to read structured data from a file, perform basic data analysis, and generate a clean, formatted PDF report using Python.

The input is a CSV file containing employee sales data. The Python script processes this data to calculate totals, averages, and department-wise breakdowns, then compiles the results into a visually formatted PDF report.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.7.9  
  Primary language used to write the data processing and PDF generation script.

- Pandas  
  Used to read the CSV file and perform data analysis operations such as summing, averaging, and grouping.

- FPDF  
  A lightweight PDF generation library in Python. It allows custom formatting, text layout, and table creation in PDFs.

## Platform and Editor

- Editor Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
  A versatile and beginner-friendly IDE for writing and testing Python code.

- Execution Platform: Windows 10  
  The script was executed in the Command Prompt using Python installed on the system.

## Real-World Applicability

This type of automated PDF report generation is widely applicable in various domains:

- Business and Sales: Automatically generating monthly or quarterly sales reports for departments or employees.
- HR & Admin: Creating employee performance summaries or attendance reports.
- Finance: Producing summaries of expenses, invoices, or transaction logs.
- Education: Automating student grade or attendance reports.

This approach eliminates the need for manual report writing and ensures accuracy, consistency, and time savings in recurring reporting tasks.
